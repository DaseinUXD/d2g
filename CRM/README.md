Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
==================================================

# The DA Suite of Transactional and Marketing Email

Guests and CRM are a primary task of every property.  DA supports this effort by providing compelling communications with guests customd designed, mobile-first, and responsibe emails. 

The ability  to retrieve guest information straight from existing Property Management Systems (PMS) provides turn-key integration of DA services.  This frees up a property's human resources so they can invest their time into other on-site guest needs (e.g., managing guest arrivals, gusts stay experience, and current guests' immediate needs.

## Basic CRM Email Types

### Reservation Confirmations (RC)
An RC is designed primarily to transmit booking details to guests.  This information includes transaction details, hotel policies, and on-site contact information.
A secondary benefit is reinforcing the guest's decision decision to stay at the property.

### Pre-Stay Marketing (PSM)
The PSM is designed to showcase the property.  Their location, amenities, dining opportunities, spa, sports, and other unique features of the property.  Compelling content, both text and imagery,  drive increased revenue.

### Cancellations (CXL)
When a guest's plans change, they recieve a CXL.  More than a transactional email , the CXL email can also provide feedback opportunities.  Gathered information helps identify the resons a guest changed their plans (e.g., competitive pricing). The property has the opportunity to contact these guests with alternate offers and attempt to recapture that revenue.

### Thank You Notes (TYN)
Provides "closure" on a guest's stay.  TYN include invitations and links to optional online surveys providing feedback to the property directly and/or through a third-party review provider (e.g., TripAdvisor).


## Extended CRM Innovations and Services

Additional services allow each property to customize their spectrum of CRM offerings to best suit their own needs. Digital Alchemy has developed many extra features that are designed to foster increased hotel guest dialog and to gather incremental revenue.


###Online Surveys (CC)
Driven through the TYN, the CC gathers important feedback.

### Cancelation Forms (CXLFORM)

### Guest Preferences (VIP)
VIP forms provide a property the guests wants and needs. This helps the property learn about a guest's unique needs (e.g., food alergies, accomodation needs) and wants (e.g, room-temperature, floor preference).  This form can also be used to up-sell custom offers to improve the guest's stay. It also helps to build a preference profile of high-value guests.
