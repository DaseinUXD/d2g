Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
==================================================

# A Comnplete Suite of Transactional and Marketing Email

The heart of the hospitality industry are guests and CRM is a primary task of every property.  We support their efforts by providing a compelling means of communication with their guests through eye-catching confirmation and marketing emails.  Furthermore, because we have the ability  to retrieve guest information straight from their existing Property Management System (PMS) frees up resources that can invest their time into better manage guest arrivals, stay experiencem, and preferences.

## Reservation Confirmations (RC)
An RC is designed primarily to transmit booking details to guests about their upcoming stay, but more importantly to reinforce their decision to stay at your property. Beautiful imagery and hints of pleasures that lie ahead will help guests feel confident with their booking decision. Links to your property’s web and social media sites are included to help drive traffic and future reservations.

## Pre-Stay Marketing (PSM)
The pre-arrival letters are designed to showcase location, amenities, dining, spa, sports and uniqueness of the property.  These email help drive increased revenue. Rich imagery and compelling messages create opportunities to increase revenue before guests even set foot on your property.

## Cancellations (CANCEL)
When a guest's plans change, they recieve this type of email.  Nevertheless, cancellation emails can open a dialog with guests, looking for those who may have changed plans due to competitive pricing. Armed with this information, Revenue Managers can contact those guests with alternate offers and try to recapture that revenue. In everything we do, we do with our client’s bottom line in mind.

## Online Surveys (CC) and Thank You Notes (TYN)
Gather important feedback. Thank You Notes add that last stamp of personalization to each visit. They include invitations and links to our optional Online Survey services


# Extended CRM Innovations and Services

Additional services allow each property to customize their spectrum of CRM offerings to best suit their own needs. Digital Alchemy has developed many extra features that are designed to foster increased hotel guest dialog and to gather incremental revenue.

## VIP forms
will help your property customize and offer premium services and products to guests. It also helps build a profile with guest preferences so that you can better suite their needs.

## Upgrade Manager
offers will quickly increase ADR, advancing the opportunity to upgrade rooms and services with unsold inventory, all at the property's discretion.

## On Property Messaging
communications are enhanced with a customized email sent after guest check-in. This interactive solution reminds the guest of your commitment to exceptional service and invites them to reply with any additional requests. Touching base while guests are still on property is the ideal time to perfect the stay experience, encouraging positive post-stay evaluations and property ratings, especially if your compensation and property is dependent on them.

## Bounce Back
What great experience isn't followed up with the offer to "do it again sometime – soon?" Bounce back offers do just that for your guests, with a personalized invitation to return during an interval planned by you. Once configured, this fully customizable feature automatically sends the invitation.
